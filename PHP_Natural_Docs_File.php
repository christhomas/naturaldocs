/******************************************************************************
 *	Package: NaturalDocs::File
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 *	A package to manage file access across platforms.  Incorporates functions
 *	from various standard File:: packages, but more importantly, works around
 *	the glorious suckage present in File::Spec, at least in version 0.82 and
 *	earlier.  Read the "Why oh why?" sections for why this package was necessary.
 *
 *	Usage and Dependencies:
 *		-	The package doesn't depend on any other Natural Docs packages and is ready to use immediately.
 *		-	All functions except <CanonizePath()> assume that all parameters are canonized.
