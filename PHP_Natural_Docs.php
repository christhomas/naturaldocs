 *
 * Topic: Code Conventions
 *
 * -	Every package function is called with an arrow operator.  It's needed for inheritance in some
 * 		places, and consistency when it's not.
 *
 * -	No constant will ever be zero or undef.  Those are reserved so any piece of code can
 * 		allow a "none of the above" option and not worry about conflicts with an existing value.
 *
 * -	Existence hashes are hashes where the value doesn't matter.  It acts more as a set, where
 * 		the existence of the key is the significant part.
 *
 * Topic: File Format Conventions
 *
 * -	All integers appear in big-endian format.  So a UInt16 should be handled with a 'n' in
 * 		pack and unpack, not with a 'S'.
 *
 * -	UString16's are a big-endian UInt16 followed by that many UTF-8 bytes.  A null-terminator is not stored.
 *
 * -	If a higher-level type is described in a file format, that means the loading and saving
 * 		format is handled by that package.  For example, if you see <SymbolString> in the format,
 * 		that means <NaturalDocs::SymbolString->ToBinaryFile()> and <NaturalDocs::SymbolString->FromBinaryFile()> are
 * 		used to manipulate it, and the underlying format should be treated as opaque.

/**
 *	Group: Basic Types
 *
 *	Types used throughout the program.  As Perl is a weakly-typed language unless you box things into
 *	objects, these types are for documentation purposes and are not enforced.
 *
 *	Type: FileName
 *
 *	A string representing the absolute, platform-dependent path to a file.  Relative file paths are no
 *	longer in use anywhere in the program.  All path manipulation should be done through <NaturalDocs::File>.
 *
 *	Type: VersionInt
 *
 *	A comparable integer representing a version number.  Converting them to and from text and binary
 *	should be handled by <NaturalDocs::Version>.
 *
 *	Type: SymbolString
 *
 *	A scalar which encodes a normalized array of identifier strings representing a full or
 *	partially-resolved symbol.  All symbols must be retrieved from plain text via <NaturalDocs::SymbolString->FromText()>
 *	so that the separation and normalization is always consistent.  SymbolStrings are comparable via string compare
 *	functions and are sortable.
 *
 *	Type: ReferenceString
 *
 *	All the information about a reference that makes it unique encoded into a string.  This includes
 *	the <SymbolString> of the reference, the scope <SymbolString> it appears in, the scope <SymbolStrings>
 *	it has access to via "using", and the <ReferenceType>.  This is done because if any of those parameters
 *	change, it needs to be treated as a completely separate reference.

/**
 *	Function: StringCompare
 *
 *	Compares two strings so that the result is good for proper sorting.  A proper sort orders the characters as
 *	follows:
 *		- End of string.
 *		- Whitespace.  Line break-tab-space.
 *		- Symbols, which is anything not included in the other entries.
 *		- Numbers, 0-9.
 *		- Letters, case insensitive except to break ties.
 *
 *	If you use cmp instead of this function, the result would go by ASCII/Unicode values which would place certain symbols
 *	between letters and numbers instead of having them all grouped together.  Also, you would have to choose between case
 *	sensitivity or complete case insensitivity, in which ties are broken arbitrarily.
 *
 *	Returns:
 *
 *	Like cmp, it returns zero if A and B are equal, a positive value if A is greater than B,
 *	and a negative value if A is less than B.
